# Card game on React

> [!WARNING]
> The links below open in the current window by default.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Backend for this project takes place in [another repository](https://github.com/bondarenkoilya1/card-game-server)

> [!NOTE]  
> This project has its own [planning board](https://github.com/users/bondarenkoilya1/projects/4)

> [!TIP]
> Temporarily this project will not contain such libs as react-query, etc.\
> The main reason for that is my willing to learn what happens under the hood.\
> That's why I will firstly write pure fetch functions and after all done - migrate to libs.
